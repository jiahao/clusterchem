1. Implement rotation of orbital guesses.

1. Make td-nonpol, td regenerate qchem.working.in if not found.

1. Implement pickling of Q-Chem scratch files into HDF5 database.
   Execution flow: save orbital data in 53.0
                   convert to CDFT-CI state using scf_guess read and cdftci_stop 1 or 2
                   after loading both states, save cdft-ci stat in 437.0
                   ~/share/sina/cdftci-dummytest : remember to stop after second state
                   Only then, issue a third input deck to run cdft-ci
   Troy feels that MOM guess from gas phase will accelerate convergence of gund and excited states
   Should precify MOM option to always reference to initial orbitals
   gas phase orbitals should be a good initial guess!
