1. Implement pickling of Q-Chem scratch files into HDF5 database.
   Execution flow: save orbital data in 43.0
                   convert to CDFT-CI state using scf_guess read and cdftci_stop 1 or 2
                   after loading both states, save cdft-ci stat in 437.0
                   ~/share/sina/cdftci-dummytest : remember to stop after second state
                   Only then, issue a third input deck to run cdft-ci
